# Rule file for fix_topology.
#
# Any line not starting with "bond", "angle" or "dihedral" is ignored,
# but the best practice is to leave non-readable lines blank or start
# them with a typical comment character, like #.
#
# The columns in the readable lines are:
#   1 : type of term (bond, angle or dihedral)
#   2 : function type used by Gromacs.
#   3 to last-1 : residuename_atomname, which may include regular expressions
#   last : Parameters, usually a Gromacs macro (eg, gb_15) or "delete"
#
# The columns must be separated by one or more spaces and/or tabs, as
# the default field separator (FS) in AWK.
#
# Equivalent definitions for bonds, angles and torsions are done
# automatically: eg, if the bond AA-BB is defined, the bond BB-AA
# doesn't need to be defined.

# Define macros:
define   (:base:)  (AR0|AR1)
define   (:sug:)   (ROS|RON)
define   (:phos:)  (POX)
## Check if the bond value is the same for other nucleotides in the FF (should be since its by atomtype)
# Bonds:
bond      1    (:base:)_N9      (:sug:)_C1'   0.14750
bond      1    (:sug:)_C5'      (:phos:)_O5'  0.14100
# This one should bond with the previous residue
bond      1    (:sug:)_-O3'      (:phos:)_P    0.16100

# Pair delete:
# pair      1    PYR_CG    (:ss:)_CA1 delete
#
# Bond angles:
#angle     2   (:tails:)_CD    (:phos:)_OD   (:phos:)_P   ga_26
# Proper dihedrals (torsions):
#dihedral  1   (:tails:)_CD    (:phos:)_OD   (:phos:)_P   (:phos:)_OA gd_20

# Improper dihedrals:
dihedral  4   (:base:)_C4     (:base:)_C8    (:base:)_N9    (:sug:)_C1'
