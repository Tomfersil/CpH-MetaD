# CpH-MetaD

## General Information

The files available in the folders are modified to allow compatibility of the st-CpHMD method with RNA and metadynamics.

The files should replace the already existing ones in the equally named folders in the source code of CpHMD-v3.0 available in the github page of the Machuqueiro Lab group (see github page: ).

Please cite the original and current versions of the st-CpHMD method and the CpHMD-metadynamics approach papers when using the method:

We thank Dr. Miguel Machuqueiro and Nuno F.B. Oliveira for access to their code and help in this current implementation.
