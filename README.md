# CpH-MetaD

## General Information

The files available in the folders are modified to allow compatibility of the st-CpHMD method with RNA and metadynamics.
The files should replace the already existing ones in the equally named folders in the source code of CpHMD-v3.0 (available on the GitHub page of Nuno F.B. Oliveira (https://github.com/NunoFBOliveira/CpHMD_v3).

To perform reweight analysis, we recommend the use of the available WHAM module on the Bussi Lab GitHub: https://bussilab.github.io/doc-py-bussilab/bussilab/wham.html .

## SOON a tutorial will be created and added to this page. 

## Acknowledgments
We thank Dr. Miguel Machuqueiro and Nuno F.B. Oliveira (see page: https://mms.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/index.html) for access to their CpHMD-V3.0 code and help in this current implementation.
