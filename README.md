# CpH-MetaD

## General Information

The files available in the folders are modified to allow compatibility of the st-CpHMD method with RNA and metadynamics.

The files should replace the already existing ones in the equally named folders in the source code of CpHMD-v3.0 available on the GitHub page of Nuno F.B. Oliveira from the Machuqueiro Lab group (see GitHub page: https://github.com/NunoFBOliveira/CpHMD_v3).

Please cite the original and current versions of the st-CpHMD method and the CpHMD-metadynamics approach papers when using the method:
1) https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c04529  # Most recent paper ;
2)  # ArXiv version of the CpH-MetaD paper;

We thank Dr. Miguel Machuqueiro and Nuno F.B. Oliveira for access to their code and help in this current implementation.
